############ Random Forest ###################

# set random seed
set.seed(123)


#** (4) question: which variables(colums) are more influencial in the estimation of total damage (crop + property damage)? ------
#   Answer: As it is shown in important variables plot, the most influencial variables are:
#   FATALITIES, LATITUDE, Population, Magnitude of hail, min tempreture, longitude, average tempratue, max tempreture, fujita scale (tornado power), economical condition for each state(rgdp), raining rate (pcp), width of turnado, ...
#   which makes sense because if you have more fatalities it is obvious that you have more property + crop damage
#   in some specific latitudes , natural events occur more times and that places are more likely to experience damages
#   having more population means that more property and crops are existed in that area, so they are more likely to suffer from natural events, and so on ...

#** Random forest for estimating total economical damage (DMG_t) ------------

# we removed crop damage (CROPDMG_t) and property damage (PROPDMG_t) because DMG_t is the sum of these two variables, and it is better to be removed to 
# distinguish what are the real variables influencing the prediction of total damage
# we also remove factors to run random forest
str(storm)

#** (5) question: which variables(colums) are more influencial in the estimation of total morbimortality (injuries + fatalities)?

#   tmax, LONGITUDE, F, pcp, pop, ...
#   which makes sense, like our previous interpretation of result again LONGITUDE is influencial (place of living is important), 
#   population is important (more population leads to more morbi and Fujita(Thurnado power) are among most influencial features)
